<p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...
<ul>
  <li>HTML is cool</li>
  <li>CSS is cooler</li>
  <li>JS is the best</li>
</ul>
<em>What do you need to create a website?</em>

<p>Not much!</p>
<ol>
<li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
<li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
<li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
<li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
</ol>

Follow my progress on <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>
